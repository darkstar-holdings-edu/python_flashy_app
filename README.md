# Python Flashy App

This is repo contains code that I generate while working on the [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) udemy course for learning Python.

This repo covers the project for day 31 of the course. This project is a flashcard application for learning languages. The current language setting is German.
